All three players were considered the best Japanese baseball player of all time, they are well respected in the country of Japan. 

The first player, Ichiro Suzuki, currently plays for the Seattle Mariners and is considered the best hitter in the World. 
He has more than **3000 hits** in the MLB, which he is already predicted to be joining the Baseball Hall of the Fame in the future. 

The second player, Yu Darvish, is currently at Chicago Cubs, expected to be an ace pitcher soon. 
He had suffered from multiple injuries and had numerous surgeries in order to get back in the game.

The last player, Shohei Ohtani, is the first Japanese player to both hit and pitch. 
The last time some player pitched a game and hit homeruns was the legendary player, Babe Ruth.

### Ichiro Suzuki 

_Ichiro Suzuki_ (鈴木 一朗 Suzuki Ichirō, born October 22, 1973), often referred to mononymously as Ichiro (イチロー Ichirō), is a Japanese former professional baseball outfielder. With 27 seasons combined in top-level professional leagues, he spent the bulk of his career with two teams: nine seasons with the Orix Blue Wave of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan, where he began his career, and 12 with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States. After playing for the Mariners, he played two and a half seasons in MLB with the New York Yankees before signing with the Miami Marlins. Ichiro played three seasons with the Marlins before returning to the Mariners in 2018. Ichiro established a number of batting records, including MLB's single-season record for hits with 262. He achieved 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player in history. Between his major league career in both Japan and the United States, Ichiro has the most hits by any player in top-tier professional leagues. He also has recorded the most hits of all Japanese born players in MLB history.

In his combined playing time in NPB and MLB, Ichiro received 17 consecutive selections both as an All-Star and Gold Glove winner, won nine league batting titles and was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) four times. While playing in NPB, he won seven consecutive batting titles and three consecutive Pacific League MVP Awards. In 2001, Ichiro became the first Japanese-born position player to be posted and signed to an MLB club.[1] He led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP.

Ichiro was the first MLB player to enter the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame (The Golden Players Club). He was a ten-time MLB All-Star and won the 2007 All-Star Game MVP Award for a three-hit performance that included the event's first-ever inside-the-park home run. Ichiro won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award in each of his first ten years in the majors, and had an American League–record seven hitting streaks of 20 or more games, with a high of 27. He is also noted for his longevity, continuing to produce at a high level with batting, slugging, and on-base percentages above .300 in 2016 while approaching 43 years of age. In, Ichiro notched the 3,000th hit of his MLB career off Chris Rusin of the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, becoming only the 30th player ever to do so. In total he has over 4,300 hits in his professional career across Japan and the United States.

#### 2018 Season 

On March 7, 2018, Ichiro signed a one-year contract to return to the Mariners.[124][125] On Opening Day, March 29, against the Cleveland Indians, Ichiro became the 20th outfielder all-time to record 5,000 career putouts at the position.[citation needed]

On May 3, the Mariners announced that Ichiro would move to the front office as a special assistant for the remainder of the season,[126] but Ichiro did not rule out a possible return as a player for the 2019 season.[127] In his final game for the year on the previous day, he went 0-for-3 with a walk, a strikeout, and a run in a 3–2 loss to the Oakland Athletics.[128] In 15 games played with the 2018 Mariners, Ichiro batted 9-for-44 (.205) without a home run or RBI.

At the time of his sabbatical as an active player, Ichiro held the record for most hits in Major League Baseball history by a foreign-born player (3,089). He was surpassed just six weeks later by Adrián Beltré.[129]

On May 11, he became the interim bench coach for 2 games as manager Scott Servais was gone to attend his daughter's college graduation and regular bench coach Many Acta filling in as manager.[130]

#### Playing Style 

While he is known for his hitting ability, he does not draw many walks. In 2004, when he set the single-season record for hits, his low walk total (49) led to him being on base a total of 315 times. It was the 58th-most times a player has reached base in a season and short of the major league record of 379 set by Babe Ruth in 1923.[132]

Ichiro has a home-run batting stroke that he displays in batting practice, but not in games.[64][132] The New York Times criticized his inability to improve his power when his Mariner teams were often low-scoring while noting that he also did not steal bases as frequently as Rickey Henderson or Tim Raines.[132] Ichiro, however, once commented, "If I'm allowed to hit .220, I could probably hit 40 [home runs], but nobody wants that."[64]

Ichiro has long been interested in pitching professionally, and he actually took the mound to pitch to one batter in the 1996 NPB All Star game, reaching close to 91 MPH (145 km) in warm up pitches.[133] In 2009, it was reported that during an early February workout at the World Baseball Classic his fastball was clocked at 92 MPH.[134] On the final day of the 2015 season on October 4, Ichiro pitched in his first MLB game, throwing one complete inning at the end of a 7–2 Marlins loss against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing one run on two hits.[97] He was still able to touch 88 mph with his fastball to go along with a mid 80s slider.[135]

### Yu Darvish 

_Yu Darvish_ (ダルビッシュ 有 Darubisshu Yū, born August 16, 1986) is a Japanese professional baseball starting pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball. Darvish previously played in MLB for the Texas Rangers and the Los Angeles Dodgers and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. In international play, Darvish pitched in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2009 World Baseball Classic as a member of the Japanese national team.[1]

He was considered by many to be the best pitcher in Japanese professional baseball prior to his arrival in Major League Baseball in 2012.[2] In his first MLB season, Darvish finished third in the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year balloting. The next season, he finished second in the AL Cy Young Award vote as he led the Major Leagues in strikeouts with 277 and finished fourth in the AL in earned run average (ERA) at 2.83. On April 6, 2014, Darvish reached the 500 strikeout mark in fewer innings pitched than any starting pitcher in MLB history.

#### 2018 Season

On February 13, 2018, Darvish signed a six-year, $126 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.[74] Darvish played his first game with the Cubs on March 31, 2018, against the Miami Marlins. He allowed 5 runs in 4.1 innings. Nevertheless, the Cubs won 10–6 in 10 innings.[75] On May 7, Darvish was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to the flu.[76] On May 26, Darvish was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right triceps tendinitis.[77] On August 19, 2018, Darvish began a rehab stint. While warming up before the second inning, Darvish summoned trainers and was removed from the game.[78] An MRI revealed Darvish had a stress reaction on his right elbow as well as a triceps strain, ending his 2018 season.[79]

#### Playing Style 

Darvish is a right-handed pitcher who throws from a three-quarter arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion.[87] He has a large frame for a pitcher, listed at 6 ft 5 in and 220 lb. Darvish throws a four-seam fastball which averages 93–95 mph (tops out at 99 mph[88]),[89][90][91] as well as a hard slurve (slider) in the low 80s with a sharp break.[89][92][93] He complements these two with a wide repertoire of secondary pitches, including a two-seam fastball (also described as a shuuto),[94] a cutter, two curveballs, a splitter, and an occasional changeup.[95] Darvish has a "fast curve" and a "slow curve", the former averaging about 80 mph and the latter about 71. The slow curve is almost exclusively used in no-strike and 1-strike counts, while the fast curve is mostly used in 2-strike counts.[96] Some professional scouts consider Darvish to have the best repertoire of quality pitches, including the best slider, in all of Major League Baseball.[89]

Advance scouting on Darvish is made difficult by his tendency to change his most frequent pitch sequences over time.[97]

While Darvish uses both the set, or "stretch" position and the windup, he has been noted for pitching exclusively from the stretch at times, even when there is no one on base.[98] While pitching from the windup is generally thought to add velocity to pitches, the set position allows pitchers more control over baserunners.[99] In Darvish's case the set position often is used as a way of keeping his delivery in sync and consistent.[98]

Prior to the 2006 season Darvish's "go-to" pitch was a screwball, and he tends to rely more on his off-speed pitches than his fastball. After injuring his shoulder in an exhibition game start against the 2006 World Baseball Classic Japanese national team in February 2006, because of the strain the screwball had gradually been putting on his shoulder, he took the pitch out of his in-game repertoire and worked to develop his splitter until it became an equally effective pitch that would replace the screwball. He also has succeeded in increasing his fastball velocity from year to year.

### Shohei Ohtani 

_Shōhei Ohtani_ (大谷 翔平 Ohtani Shōhei, born July 5, 1994) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher and designated hitter for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Pacific League. Ohtani was the first pick of the Fighters in the 2012 draft. He has officially recorded the fastest pitch by a Japanese pitcher and in NPB history at 165 kilometres per hour (102.5 mph).

#### 2018 Season 

On December 8, 2017, Ohtani agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Angels. The deal was finalized the next day.[26] On December 13, it was revealed that Ohtani was diagnosed with a first-degree UCL sprain in his right elbow. He received a platelet-rich plasma injection to treat the pain.[27]

Ohtani made the 25-man roster and started as the designated hitter on Opening Day against the Oakland Athletics. He singled in his first at-bat.[28] On April 1, he made his pitching debut, striking out six batters in six innings while allowing three runs, to pick up his first MLB win. On April 3, Ohtani hit his first MLB home run, a 397-foot three-run homer against Josh Tomlin.[29] The following day, he hit his second, becoming the first Angels player to homer in his first two career home games. He tied the franchise record of 12 total bases, and five RBI through his first three consecutive career games (both set by Bobby Clark in 1979).[30] On April 6, he hit his third home run in three days, becoming the first Angels rookie to do so.[31] In only his second start on the mound on April 8, Ohtani took a perfect game through 6⅓ innings before allowing a hit. Overall, Ohtani pitched seven scoreless innings while striking out 12.[32] Making his third start pitching on April 18 against the Boston Red Sox, Ohtani exited after two innings due to a blister on his right middle finger.[33] On June 7, Ohtani left the game after a blister on the same finger. The next day, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his MLB career due to a Grade 2 UCL sprain in his right elbow. He received platelet-rich plasma and stem-cell injections to treat the pain.[34]

Ohtani was activated from the disabled list as a hitter on July 2, and went 0-for-4 against the Seattle Mariners.[35] On August 3, Ohtani hit two home runs against the Cleveland Indians, marking his first career multiple-home run game and his first two home runs in a road game.[36]

After Ohtani had not pitched for 11 weeks, Angels manager Mike Scioscia announced that Ohtani would start the game against the Houston Astros on September 2.[37] Even though he threw just 49 pitches over 2 1/3 innings and allowed two runs, he became the first major leaguer in nearly a century to hit 15 home runs and pitch 50 innings in a season, previously accomplished by Babe Ruth in 1919.[38] ESPN announced on the following day that doctors recommended that Ohtani undergo Tommy John surgery, after an MRI showed new damage to his UCL that might potentially keep him off the mound until 2020.[39] On September 7, Ohtani broke the home run record hit by a Japanese rookie when he blasted his 19th home run for the season.[40]

#### Playing Style 

##### Pitching

Ohtani is a 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), 203 pounds (92 kg) right-handed starting pitcher.[42] With an overhand delivery, he throws a four-seam fastball averaging 97 miles per hour (156 km/h)[42],[43] an 86–88 miles per hour (138–142 km/h) splitter with late diving action [44], forkball[45] an occasional curveball, and a solid slider at 82–84 miles per hour (132–135 km/h).[46] He posted a BB/9 (walks per nine innings rate) of 3.3 in his NPB career.[47] Ohtani has been compared to Justin Verlander by some MLB scouts.[48]

##### Hitting and Fielding 

Ohtani is a left-handed batter. He is a designated hitter and occasional outfielder known for being able to hit with home run power.[49] Scouts have timed Ohtani running from the batter’s box to first base in as little as 3.8 seconds.[50]
